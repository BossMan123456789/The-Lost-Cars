Once upon a time, there were 2 cars. 
Their names were Car1 and Car2. 
They were going to the supermarket to get some fuel. 
They got lost along the way and asked a supercar for help. 
He took them some of the way very quickly, but he too got lost. 
Then they came across a truck. 
The truck took them to the supermarket and gave them a map too. 
Now, the cars and trucks won't get lost again.
